        <br><hr>
            <p>     Hello my name is Jeremy, I moved to Rhode Island from New York
                to pursue my career in coding. I chose to go in the coding field because 
                I fell in love with games and the concept of how they were made. That's 
                the reason I chose this path.

     <p>                    I'm not a very social person so making a bio is new since I 
        only know how to talk about schoolwork and video games. I primarily 
        play Xbox but I also play any other gaming device. I love indie and 
        roguelike games some major ones I know are: Balatro, Dead Cells, Slay The Spire,
        and Elden Ring. I hope to have a fun year with everyone at NEIT.</p>
